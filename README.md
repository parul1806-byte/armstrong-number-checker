# Armstrong Number Checker in Python

This Python program checks whether a given number is an **Armstrong number**.  
An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.  
For example: `153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153`.

##  Logic Used
- Extract digits using modulus (%) and floor division (//)
- Cube each digit and add to a sum
- Compare the final sum with the original number

##  Example
```python
Input: 153  
Output: it is an armstrong number
